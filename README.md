# file-encryption

In terminal, type: `pip install cryptography`

In `file_cryptography.py` line 3, enter the filename of the file you want to encrypt, a file named `test.txt` has been provided for you as an example

When you run the program, a new crypto key will be generated, and 2 new files named with `encrypted_{filename}` and `decrypted_{filename}` to show proof of the file cryptography working.

I've added an additional folder called File Cryptography Example, for you to see how the files should look.
